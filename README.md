# Northwind Shipping

Northwind Trade is a company specializing in shipping various fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) worldwide. The Shipping Manager lacks visibility into the monthly order processing and shipping volumes. They require a dashboard that allows them to select a specific month and obtain information on the daily number of outstanding orders and their respective shipping destinations. The dashboard can be accessed through this link [Northwind Shipping Analytics](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nilay.patel6829/viz/NorthwindShipping_17041366704630/Dashboard1)
